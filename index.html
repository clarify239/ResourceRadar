      <h1><b>Renewable Energy</b></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> Electricity is one of the biggest industries in the modern-day. We use electricity in everything we do, from
        entertainment to refrigeration. Electricity is primarily powered through hot air turning a generator, which
        converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. To heat the air, however, we need to burn a heat source. </p>
      <p>Fossil fuels, while being the leading source of this type of energy for the United States, are harming the
        environment and climate more each day. Carbon footprints and fossil fuels are increasing rapidly, which is
        harmful
        to the environment. Renewable energy sources can be used in place of harmful energy sources. These renewable
        energy
        sources naturally replenish themselves, meaning there is an abundance of them on Earth. Using renewable energy
        sources will have a major positive impact on the environment. These resources not only help the environment,
        but
        it also creates a diversity of resources for others to use. As governments expand more into renewable
        resources
        and they become cheaper for the consumer, it is vital for families to invest in renewable resources. </p>

    <h1><b>Our Purpose</b></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      We created this website allow others to learn more about the environment and the harm we bring upon it when we are
      not careful with the resources we use. Our Information page provides information on 5 different types of energy
      sources. We also created the survey for others to be more aware of the best renewable energy source they can use
      that's near them. We hope to have a positive impact on everyone, and for everyone to be inspired to use resources
      that are better for their environment.

    <h1><b>Who is R.E.G.I.E?</b></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>R.E.G.I.E stands for renewable energy guidance intelligence engineering. It is a virtual intelligence bot who
      helps
      find the most easily accesible energy source for the user. By analysing the data from specific questions regarding
      geography
      and household income, R.E.G.I.E is able to determine if solar energy, geothermal energy, hydroelectric energy,
      wind
      energy, or bioenergy is the best suited renewable energy source. Talk to Regie today!!</p>
