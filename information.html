          <h2 class="energy-title">Solar Energy</h2>
          <p class="energy-desc">Solar energy is one of the main forms of renewable energy, generated by the sun. It is
            created by nuclear
            fusion, which occurs when protons & hydrogen atoms collide to create helium. Solar energy is constantly
            being
            created and flowing around, which is beneficial to the environment. It is the cleanest and most abundant
            source
            of renewable energy. It has a variety of uses, being used for electricity, heating, commercial use, etc.

            Solar energy is used to power different technologies, such as photovoltaics and solar power. Photovoltaics
            convert sunlight energy into electricity. This product is useful for providing electricity to different
            locations in an environmentally safe manner. Solar panels are used for powering homes in different ways.
            These
            panels are helpful in reducing carbon footprints, which in turn, have a positive impact on your environment.

      <section id=wind>
        <div class="child-items">
          <h2 class="energy-title">Wind Energy</h2>
          <p>Wind energy is one of the cleanest renewable energy sources. It uses mechanical power to generate wind
            energy, meaning it is a very abundant resource as well. Therefore, wind energy is also very beneficial to
            the
            environment, as it only uses mechanical power to generate energy. Not only that, but wind power is not a
            very
            expensive resource, meaning more people will have access to it.

            Wind power is used in a variety of ways, such as in wind turbines. Wind turbines are able to transform their
            power into electricity. This technology is most useful in areas such as Texas, where wind energy is used for
            grinding grain and pumping water.

        <div class="child-items">
          <h2 class="energy-title">Hydroelectric</h2>
          <p>
            Hydropower has been used for a long time, being one of the oldest forms of renewable energy. Hydroelectric
            energy uses the natural flow of water to generate energy and electricity. Since hydropower relies mainly on
            the flow of water in nature, this is a relatively low-cost form of energy. It is also very abundant and
            lasts
            a long time, meaning its facilities would not need to be replaced as often.

            Hydroelectric energy is often associated with dams – especially the Hoover Dam. Water in dams is also used
            to
            create electricity in plants. The energy in water power plants are used and then converted into mechanical
            energy, which is used to power different products near rivers and lakes. Hydropower is also a very reliable
            source of energy, because it relies only on water energy, meaning it is often used as a backup power plan.

      <section id=geothermal>
        <div class="child-items">
          <h2 class="energy-title">Geothermal</h2>
          <p>Geothermal energy is contained within the Earth. It is considered a renewable energy source because it is
            continuously produced in the Earth, and therefore, will have an abundance of it in the Earth.

            Geothermal heat is used to power individual buildings or multiple buildings with a heating system. Resources
            near the earth’s surface are piped into buildings which are then used for heat. Geothermal power plants are
            normally built near the earth’s surface in order to get the best results and the most power.

      <section id=bioenergy>
        <div class="child-items">
          <h2 class="energy-title">Bioenergy</h2>
          <p>Bioenergy is produced from renewable biological resources. Although other renewable energy sources are very
            reliable, they are not able to replace fuel or gasoline. Biofuels, a derivative of bioenergy, are helpful in
            these aspects, creating ethanol to replace gasoline. Biofuels are mainly used for transportation fuels,
            heat,
            and electricity generation.

            In terms of electricity, bioenergy can be stored with little energy loss and emits no greenhouse gasses. It
            doubles as a waste disposal measure and is widely available, especially in rural areas where many sources
            aren’t as available.
